We have chosen to create the game connect-4(four).

Connect 4 is a game that is played by two players on a single screen(grid/board) where the players can drop coins in the empty columns on the board.
Each player will have access to use coins before the start of the game.
The player should be able to make moves (place coin) alternatively by clicking on the desired column on the grid(board).
Each playerâ€™s coin has different colours (eg: red for the first player and yellow for the second player).
The first player to connect 4 coins on the grid(board), horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with their assigned colour of the coin, should be declared the winner of the game.
If all the empty holes in the board are filled and none of the players were able to win the game, then it should be declared as a draw.


This game can be liked by those people who wants entertainment and mind-relaxation.
We completed this project using python programming language with libraries pygame, pygame-menu, and numpy.

When you click on the Play button, a new game screen will appear. The game screen shows the Connect 4 board and provides the following features:

The board consists of a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns.
Players take turns dropping their discs into the columns by clicking on the desired column.
Discs always fall straight down and stack on top of each other.
The game continues until one player successfully connects four discs straight through any direction or the entire board is filled.
If a player wins, a message will be displayed indicating the winning player.
If the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed indicating a draw.

At the top right corner of the game screen, you will find two buttons:
